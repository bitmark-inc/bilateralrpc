Files in this directory are derived from Go source code

* File: `server.go` is derived from the `net/rpc/server.go` module
  + This is stripped down to provide only the server registration system
    so as to allow compatability with the Go library RPC callback API.

* File: `LICENSE` is the original Go license for this file.
